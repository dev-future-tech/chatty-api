= Bookings Experiment

== Overview

This controller will offer the ability to find a reservation for a customer based on their past bookings with the company.

Past bookings will include:

* Room type
* Dates stayed
* Amount spent (time and cost)
* Any other expenditures that were tracked (e.g. room service, restaurant orders)
* Destination (City & Country)

It should also be able to tap into any hobbies the user has recorded to influence the trip

Other inputs will be:

* current known campaigns
* locations of current destinations

Different customers will be created each with a bias to a particular part of the world.
