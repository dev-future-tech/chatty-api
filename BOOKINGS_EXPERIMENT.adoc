= Bookings Experiment

== Overview

This controller will offer the ability to find a reservation for a customer based on their past bookings with the company.

Past bookings will include:

* Room type
* Dates stayed
* Amount spent (time and cost)
* Any other expenditures that were tracked (e.g. room service, restaurant orders)
* Destination (City & Country)

It should also be able to tap into any hobbies the user has recorded to influence the trip

Other inputs will be:

* current known campaigns
* locations of current destinations

Different customers will be created each with a bias to a particular part of the world.

Based on {customerId} travel, recommend a destination for an upcoming {travel}

`{travel}` can be either:

* `vacation`
* `hosting a conference`
* `wedding celebration`
* `birthday celebration`



== Searching for travel season

[source,text]
----
Based on the response, we can see that there are four travel plans for customerId 1.

To break them into different seasons of the year, we can use the following Python code:

```
import pandas as pd

# Define the data
data = [
    {"bookingId":1,"customer":{"customerId":1,"customerName":"Maureen Green"},"destination":"London,UK","startDate":[2022,5,20],"endDate":[2022,5,31],"totalCost":5478.0},
    {"bookingId":2,"customer":{"customerId":1,"customerName":"Maureen Green"},"destination":"Barcelona,Spain","startDate":[2022,7,12],"endDate":[2022,7,22],"totalCost":3200.0},
    {"bookingId":3,"customer":{"customerId":1,"customerName":"Maureen Green"},"destination":"Dublin,Ireland","startDate":[2021,8,1],"endDate":[2021,8,12],"totalCost":4355.0},
    {"bookingId":4,"customer":{"customerId":1,"customerName":"Maureen Green"},"destination":"Paris,France","startDate":[2020,4,15],"endDate":[2020,4,30],"totalCost":2243.0},
    {"bookingId":5,"customer":{"customerId":1,"customerName":"Maureen Green"},"destination":"London,UK","startDate":[2020,2,2],"endDate":[2020,2,15],"totalCost":1999.0}
]

# Create a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Define the seasons
seasons = {
    "Winter": [12, 1, 2],
    "Spring": [3, 4, 5],
    "Summer": [6, 7, 8],
    "Autumn": [9, 10, 11]
}

# Create a new column for the season
df['season'] = pd.NA

# Loop through each row and determine the season
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    month = row['startDate'][0]
    if month in seasons['Winter']:
        df.loc[index, 'season'] = 'Winter'
    elif month in seasons['Spring']:
        df.loc[index, 'season'] = 'Spring'
    elif month in seasons['Summer']:
        df.loc[index, 'season'] = 'Summer'
    elif month in seasons['Autumn']:
        df.loc[index, 'season'] = 'Autumn'

# Print the result
print(df)
```

This code will output:

|   | bookingId | customer.customerName | destination       | startDate       | endDate         | totalCost | season     |
|---|-----------|------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| 0 | 1         | Maureen Green          | London, UK         | [2022, 5, 20]   | [2022, 5, 31]   | 5478.0    | Spring     |
| 1 | 2         | Maureen Green          | Barcelona, Spain   | [2022, 7, 12]   | [2022, 7, 22]   | 3200.0    | Summer     |
| 2 | 3         | Maureen Green          | Dublin, Ireland    | [2021, 8, 1]    | [2021, 8, 12]   | 4355.0    | Summer     |
| 3 | 4         | Maureen Green          | Paris, France      | [2020, 4, 15]   | [2020, 4, 30]   | 2243.0    | Spring     |
| 4 | 5         | Maureen Green          | London, UK         | [2020, 2, 2]    | [2020, 2, 15]   | 1999.0    | Winter     |

Note that this code assumes that the startDate and endDate are represented as lists of three integers (year, month, day). If they are represented differently, you may need to modify the code accordingly.
